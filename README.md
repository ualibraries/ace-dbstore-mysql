## Introduction

This docker image is provided to automatically create the database needed to run [Ace Integrity Management Service](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/adapt/index.php/Ace:Ace_IMS_System) (ace-ims) and multiple databases for each instance of an [Ace Audit Manager](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/adapt/index.php/Ace:Main) (ace-am), which taken together form the ACE [Auditing Control Environment](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/adapt/index.php/Ace).

This docker image is part of a set created by the [University of Arizona Libraries](https://github.com/ualibraries) to implement open fixity solutions based on [Ace Audit Manager](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/adapt/index.php/Ace:Main)

* [ace-dbstore-mysql](https://github.com/ualibraries/ace-dbstore-mysql) - provides a [mysql](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/) instance that will auto-create a dynamic number of ace-audit-manager databases and one ace-integrity-manager database.
* [ace-integrity-management](https://github.com/ualibraries/ace-integrity-management) - provides the [Ace Integrity Management Service](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/adapt/index.php/Ace:Ace_IMS_System) service, running within the [glassfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlassFish) based [Payara](https://www.payara.fish/) J2EE application container.
* [ace-audit-manager](https://github.com/ualibraries/ace-audit-manager) - provides the [Ace Audit Manager Service](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/adapt/index.php/Ace:Audit_Manager_Installation_Guide) fixity calculation and verification service, running within a [tomcat 8.5](http://tomcat.apache.org/) web servlet container.

## Background

When looking over the ACE [architecture](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/adapt/images/5/5b/DigCCurr2009_060909.pdf) the ace-am's role is to provide fixity auditing of an archival collection, generating checksums of files to enable the auditing. The role of the ace-ims is to prove the checksum's generated by an audit manager have not gotten corrupted.

There is usually many deployments of ACE Audit Manager which all connect to the same ACE Integrity Management Service.

This docker image was created via from the database creation portion of [manual instructions](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/adapt/index.php/Ace:Audit_Manager_Installation_Guide) for setting up the ACE audit manager. The [source code](https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/adapt/ace) for the entire ACE suite is hosted on [gitlab](https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/groups/adapt)

A good [comparison chart](http://digitalpowrr.niu.edu/digital-preservation-101/tool-grid/) between different archiveval storage systems is provided by digitalpowrr.

## Dependencies
### Host system dependencies
1. [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/) is installed on the system.
2. No other service on the system is listening at port 3306.
3. For production instances, a persistant place to store the mysql data files mounted into the docker image at /var/lib/mysql.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables control the docker setup.

Notice the ACE1...ACEn environment variables. They allow for specifying n Ace Audit Manager database instances, where the ACEn_AM_DATABASE, ACEn_AMDBA_USER, ACEn_AMDBA_PASSWORD triplet variables each need to be defined.

* ACE_DBSTORE - This host directory location to persistantly store data files. The default is to create a non-persistant, temporary docker volume called 'dbstore'.
* ACE_IMS_DATABASE - the ace-ims database name to create, defaults to 'imsdb'.
* ACE_IMSDBA_USER - the ace-ims dba user to create, defaults to 'aceims'.
* ACE_IMSDBA_PASSWORD - the ace-ims dba user password, defaults to 'ace'.
* ACE1_AM_DATABASE - the first ace-am database name to create, defaults to 'amdb1'.
* ACE1_AMDBA_USER - the first ace-am dba user to create, defaults to 'aceam1'.
* ACE1_AMDBA_PASSWORD - the first ace-am dba user password, defaults to 'ace'.
* ACEn_AM_DATABASE - the nth ace-am database name to create, defaults to ''.
* ACEn_AMDBA_USER - the nth ace-am dba user to create, defaults to ''.
* ACEn_AMDBA_PASSWORD - the nth ace-am dba user password, defaults to ''.

## Deployment

There are a couple docker-compose deployments provided:

1. [Self contained](#self-contained)
2. [Singleton](#singleton)

## Self contained

A docker-compose example integrating with a mysql docker container is located at [compose/fixity-db](https://github.com/ualibraries/ace-audit-manager/tree/master/compose/fixity-db). If the public ace-ims service ims.umiacs.umd.edu:8080 is used and an smtp service is available then this docker-compose provides a way to quickly install and try out ace-am.

To test out ACE Audit Manager, run the following commands:

```
	
	git clone https://github.com/ualibraries/ace-audit-manager.git
	cd ace-audit-manager/compose/fixity-db
	docker-compose up -d
	
```

Then browse to [http://localhost:8080/ace-am](http://localhost:8080/ace-am)

After getting it up and running, follow the [3. Register your first collection](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/adapt/index.php/Ace:Audit_Manager_Installation_Guide) instructions. The docker image mounts /mnt from the host into to docker container, so any shares that have been mounted underneath this will be available to create a collection with for fixity auditing.

To cleanup the above test instance, run:

```
	
	git clone https://github.com/ualibraries/ace-audit-manager.git
	cd ace-audit-manager/compose/fixity
	docker-compose rm -fsv
	docker volume prune  # Enter y
	
```

Two docker containers will be created, validate by running **docker ps -a**

* fixitydb_audit_1 - contains ace audit manager running under tomcat
* fixitydb_db-host_1 - contains a mysql database used by ace audit manager.

## Singleton

The singleton docker-compose example located at [compose/fixity](https://github.com/ualibraries/ace-audit-manager/tree/master/compose/fixity) just installs the ace-am by itself, so it requires an external database and ace-ims to connect to.

This docker-compose example is more likely to be used in a production environment where there is a dedicated database and ace-ims machine that are used by a number of ace-am machines.

## Scripts

Ace Audit manager is quite feature-full, however some scripts have been written to help work with huge 10+ terrabyte archival storages in the [scripts](https://github.com/ualibraries/ace-audit-manager/tree/master/scripts) directory.

### [parse-checksum-duplicates.pl](https://github.com/ualibraries/ace-audit-manager/tree/master/scripts/parse-checksum-duplicates.pl)

Ace-ims can generate a duplicate file report by clicking on a collection, then clicking on the *more...*->*Show Duplicate Files* menu item. However, this times out for huge archives, so a workaround is to download the checksum list report via *more...*->*Download checkm list* and on the command line run the **parse-checksum-duplicates.pl** script against the checksum list via:


```
	
	cat Summary.txt | ./parse-checksum-duplicates.pl > duplicates.txt
	
```

The duplicate files are organized by their common checksum value. This script requires that perl is installed and in the PATH environment variable list.
 
At the end of the report are two summations:

* DUPLICATES_FILES - contains the total count of files that should get removed so that there are no more duplicates in the collection.
* DUPLICATES_TOTAL - contains the number of duplicate sets, ie files that all have the same checksum, within the collection.
